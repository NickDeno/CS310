## CS310 Repository
This repo contains Homework and Project code from my CS310 - Data Struct & Algorithms class at Binghamton University in Spring 2024.
## Final Project
* Developed a C++ program implementing binary tree and heap data strucures to manage Song objects, supporting real-time updates and reorganization.
* Designed binary tree to dynamically maintain Songs sorted by ID number for efficient retrieval and management.
* Designed a max heap to prioritize Songs based on listen time, enabling dynamic ranking with updates during program runtime.
* Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills in managing object-oriented complexity and optimizing data structure interactions
## Class Syllabus

Analysis of the design, implementation, and properties of basic and advanced data structures, including lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs. Design and time-space analysis of basic and advanced algorithms, including searching, sorting, insert/delete, hash table collision resolution techniques, recursive functions, balanced tree maintenance, and graph algorithms. Weekly required laboratory programming and three or more additional programming projects in C++. Practical programming techniques including C++ templates and the Standard Template Library (STL), operator overloading, C++ stream I/O, separate compilation using makefiles, debugging tools and techniques, dynamic memory management.
